# ProjectSurvivor
SDL2 based game project
It's a simple game where the goal is to survive 30 days
Each day ypu have to do either of the tasks:
1 - hunt for food
2 - search for water
3 - upgrade shelter/armor or expand inventory

Each of the tasks compromises some of the hunger/thirst/health bars.

Have fun and be aware of the storms!
